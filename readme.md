# IASC 2P02 | Nicole Morgan

## Bio

My name is Nicole and I'm in my second year of the IASC program at Brock University in Ontario, studying game design and digital media. This year has piqued my interest in user and interface design and cultural studies, which I’m interesting in studying further. Academic institutions have their own culture and the study of that in particular is fascinating, which is why some of my projects focus on the academic view itself as a topic of study rather than just a lens through which to conduct scholarly studies. Scholarly points of view also tend to clash with each other the way subcultures do, further highlighting the validity of defining and studying it as a culture all its own rather than a simple tool or location that’s used to produce research without influencing it. Scholars need to be aware of the impact of their academic point of view on their research and call that out within said research, being aware of its presence the way one should be aware of the impact or limitation of any other influence, tool, or method. In the future, I would like to study this impact of academia itself in fields other than just digital humanities, and even compare how this influence impacts things and is also treated differently in different fields of study.

## Featured Project: The Datasets of Digital Humanities

This academic blog article tackles the question of raw data’s use and even existence in the digital humanities, struggling between treating datasets like one would in sciences as pure, raw data that can be used by different scholars, and treating data like a unique humanities resource influenced and tailored by the research it was collected for and the methods used to collect it. In this article, explain how succumbing to this ‘one or the other’ thinking is inherently unfitting for the digital humanities and that the answer lies in simply being aware of data’s influences and limitations and including these factors as part of your research, allowing other scholars to either knowingly use your data – with the same disclaimers – or collect their own data with a better idea of what data their research needs to cover and include or be wary of. This kind of self-awareness within academia is extremely important and perhaps often undervalued, as reusing datasets that don’t fit your needs or using research without looking at the data that goes into it can result in meaningless, generalized ‘data’ such as graphs, tables, and concepts, that don’t inherently say or prove anything but can be made to fit a theory and therefore are worthless to build more research off of. This is something that all academics and researchers within humanities should be aware of and understand, to be able to better critically analyze texts and the data behind them before treating it like raw, unbiased data that can be reused without due consideration and explanation.

My research in this academic article has evolved over the semester and with feedback from my professor, including some grammatical refinements seen [here]( https://github.com/n0proxy/IASC-2P02/commit/d45052169b0d60fcd164fd30ab0974d4eb66d88e). My analysis has also become more specific and I have expanded my ability to articulate my arguments and give compelling examples and explanations, including deeper analysis and more impactful use of the data visualization that I included to directly make my points (seen [here]( https://github.com/n0proxy/IASC-2P02/commit/92c2b8b3a9c0cf7b8e8569ae003d01135b55179c)). As the graph was a key part of my ability to actively demonstrate my argument, I needed to incorporate and wield it more specifically, and focusing on that task actually clarified and strengthened my thesis a great deal. Another part that I was encouraged to expand upon was the outside reading that I cited and how I was using the author’s perhaps indirectly similar point to reinforce my own, which also lead to increased clarification on my own point and refined my arguments (seen [here]( https://github.com/n0proxy/IASC-2P02/commit/021021aaf7a08ccf79d453d49ce2adba3671deb0)) to settle that in my readers’ minds before moving on to the demonstration using the visualization. Overall, the expanding and clarification of my thesis and a renewed focus on using my graph to its fullest as both an example and an interesting teaching moment has strengthened by article tremendously as well as made it clearer to read and understand. The flow has also improved by expanding on previously short points and by introducing and referring to the visualization more rigorously directly where it is introduced rather than including it only as an add-on to my conclusion paragraph.

## Collaborative Project: The Modernist Journals

This collaborative presentation project is to introduce and analyze the Modernist Journals Project, which is an online collection of Modernist journals from all over the English-speaking world and includes tools for text analysis from among the journal entries, including search functions, datasets on the metadata of journals such as publish date, nationality, topic, and more, with the ability to combine this data in different ways to produce a multitude of information. We created several different kinds of graphs looking at how many articles different regions of the world were producing at different times in history, and their growth or decline that were likely related to historical events like war and national independence, and presented all of the above in a powerpoint presentation to our peers. 

Collaboration is an important part of academic culture, as humanity has advanced this far only by pooling our knowledge to create stepping stones for future research and working with on another on projects themselves. When working together with people on a single project, organization and division of labor is key – divide and conquer, after all. Multiple people applying their strengths and focus to different (though sometimes overlapping) sections of a project enables a higher level of work and research compared to a single person having to work to their strengths as well as their weaknesses. This is how we approached this collaborative project, as seen in this picture of one presentation slide that I focused on.

It’s also important to be aware of collaboration and team organization as skills all their own, and to reflect on what decisions were made in organizing labor and what tools were used to facilitate collaboration. Being clear to your team about who is doing what – and the team being clear with each other on what their strengths are and how they should be best put to use – and what deadlines and guidelines are is extremely important. My team used the most fluid, real-time collaboration tool at our disposal, which was Google Slides, but also used GitHub to secure and store our files (one of my own contributions for this purpose can be seen [here]( https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/75971ef1b5bdd7b2f04d5ecf8b9dd732a56b993f)), and therefore took time to reflect on the tools we used and their effectiveness as part of our research and presentation. This was another powerpoint slide that fell under my strengths and can be seen below.
